This MERN stack based online retail application uses Node.js as the backend, React as the frontend with Express.js for routing and MongoDB for data storage. 

This application also makes use of Github, Facebook and Google OAuth techniques as well as the traditional user registration and login.
I have also used a Twilio Send-Grid Api service to send emails for various purposes.


To run :

npm start for running both backend and frontend.

Open two terminals one for backend folder and one for . folder.
Run npm start at both places
